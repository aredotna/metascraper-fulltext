For one, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes published an op-ed in the <i>New York Times</i> calling for the break up of the company he co-founded with his roommate Mark Zuckerberg in their Harvard dorm room 12 years before. With over 2.5 billion active monthly users, Facebook is now larger than most countries. (That number is courtesy Facebook and reported by Google, so it’s worth maintaining a healthy skepticism.) It was nothing less than remarkable to read Hughes’ plea to break up Facebook given everything he has personally and professionally invested in the company. It seems that Hughes had second thoughts about the net social effect of so much social media. </p><figure data-asset-id=\"5BThqThSzUteGBb31fnFzB\">\n  <img sizes=\"(min-width: 670px) 670px, 100vw\" srcset=\"//images.ctfassets.net/xq10wb7ogoji/5BThqThSzUteGBb31fnFzB/fe8bad727ebf417801822de0bcd59486/image1.jpg?w=670 670w, //images.ctfassets.net/xq10wb7ogoji/5BThqThSzUteGBb31fnFzB/fe8bad727ebf417801822de0bcd59486/image1.jpg?w=1340 1340w, //images.ctfassets.net/xq10wb7ogoji/5BThqThSzUteGBb31fnFzB/fe8bad727ebf417801822de0bcd59486/image1.jpg?w=2010 2010w\" alt=\"Zuck and Hughes\">\n  <figcaption>Mark Zuckerberg and Chris Hughes as babies </figcaption>\n</figure><p>After he left Silicon Valley in 2007, Hughes bought a magazine — east coast stalwart <i>The New Republic</i> — in 2012 and completely overhauled its editorial and design approach. Following an internal revolt to so many immediate changes, he quickly sold the magazine and moved on to advocating for a universal basic income.

In the run-up to the United States presidential race in November 2020, Democratic candidates seem to be stumbling over each other to advocate for and articulate a plan that would regulate large American tech companies on the grounds of monopoly and Federal Trade Commission laws. Most directly, Elizabeth Warren has a plan. She has proposed federal regulations that would break up many of the largest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, into several smaller companies focused on discrete businesses. It follows in the spirit of the Bell Telephone System breakup in into so many “Baby Bells” as of January 1, 1984.</p><figure data-asset-id=\"3CD8AfxVyUzgFQnd3sbIdz\">\n  <img sizes=\"(min-width: 670px) 670px, 100vw\" srcset=\"//images.ctfassets.net/xq10wb7ogoji/3CD8AfxVyUzgFQnd3sbIdz/abaf5ac54af3e814ab17d0de23ec286e/image6.jpg?w=670 670w, //images.ctfassets.net/xq10wb7ogoji/3CD8AfxVyUzgFQnd3sbIdz/abaf5ac54af3e814ab17d0de23ec286e/image6.jpg?w=1340 1340w, //images.ctfassets.net/xq10wb7ogoji/3CD8AfxVyUzgFQnd3sbIdz/abaf5ac54af3e814ab17d0de23ec286e/image6.jpg?w=2010 2010w\" alt=\"liz warren \">\n  <figcaption>Liz Warren has a plan </figcaption>\n</figure><p>Reporting around Cambridge Analytica and Facebook broke in 2018.

Facebook is also consolidating its individual business units—including Whatsapp and Instagram—inextricably into Facebook proper. (This despite its pledges to each company when it was acquired that it would be allowed to remain functionally independent.)

Prevailing software business models rely on large user bases whose personal data, engagement, and performance can be captured and monetized by selling a perfectly segmented audience to advertisers.

Their customers are other businesses and individuals who use the data metrics to target online advertising with unprecedented precision.

Rather than disappearing into the K-hole of an infinitely-scrolling feed, a user might become more attuned to their environment, more sensitive, more aware, and more in the moment.

He recalls being laid up in bed with a broken leg and receiving a visit from a friend, who arrived with a new record of harp music. After the visit, Eno’s friend left the record playing on the stereo. The volume was very low, so low that he could barely hear it, and he also couldn’t get up to change it. Outside, it was raining, and the sounds of the raindrops mixed with the plucks of the harp strings. The music was indistinguishable from its environment. For Eno, this sprouted a new thought: music could be intentionally designed for the background. It would still be serious, as carefully constructed as a symphony and as cleverly crafted as a good pop song, but it would also be designed to be ignored. This was a radical idea, if not entirely original, and Eno called it Ambient Music. His initial experiments used studio outtakes from David Bowie’s <i>Low, </i>which Eno produced in 1977, to create tape loops that he sequenced and collaged in overlapping and repeating configurations. His first proper ambient record, <i>Music for Airports</i>, was released in 1978.</p><p>In the liner notes, Eno makes his intention explicit:</p><blockquote><p>The concept of music designed specifically as a background feature in the environment was pioneered by Muzak Inc. in the fifties, and has since come to be known generically by the term Muzak. The connotations that this term carries are those particularly associated with the kind of material that Muzak Inc. produces - familiar tunes arranged and orchestrated in a lightweight and derivative manner. Understandably, this has led most discerning listeners (and most composers) to dismiss entirely the concept of environmental music as an idea worthy of attention.</p><p>Over the past three years, I have become interested in the use of music as ambience, and have come to believe that it is possible to produce material that can be used thus without being in any way compromised. To create a distinction between my own experiments in this area and the products of the various purveyors of canned music, I have begun using the term Ambient Music.</p><p>An ambience is defined as an atmosphere, or a surrounding influence: a tint. My intention is to produce original pieces ostensibly (but not exclusively) for particular times and situations with a view to building up a small but versatile catalogue of environmental music suited to a wide variety of moods and atmospheres.</p><p>Whereas the extant canned music companies proceed from the basis of regularizing environments by blanketing their acoustic and atmospheric idiosyncracies, Ambient Music is intended to enhance these. Whereas conventional background music is produced by stripping away all sense of doubt and uncertainty (and thus all genuine interest) from the music, Ambient Music retains these qualities. And whereas their intention is to `brighten' the environment by adding stimulus to it (thus supposedly alleviating the tedium of routine tasks and levelling out the natural ups and downs of the body rhythms) Ambient Music is intended to induce calm and a space to think.</p><p>Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.</p></blockquote><p>What if you took these ideas and applied them to software? Software might create a social network that exists quietly in the background, rather than commanding your attention via shrill notifications or gamifying the experience with rewards such as likes. This software might not ask you to perform as much as it would facilitate awareness. It might reveal affinities and foster concentration. (After all, it’s easier to concentrate in a library than in a shopping mall.)
